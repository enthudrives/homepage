<p>When a method has a for, if-else blocks, with Java 8, it is tempting to convert the whole block to a single statement with lambdas.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>for (Book book : books) {
  if (book.isAvailable()) {
    System.out.println("Available book: " + book.getName());
  }
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Most of the time, for and if blocks are a clear code smell. They make me wonder if there is room for refactoring there. With Java 8, the above for loop could be converted to this one-liner.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>books
  .stream()
  .filter(Book::isAvailable())
  .map(Book::getName())
  .forEach(name -&gt; System.out.println("Available book: " + name));
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Woohoo. We have no for loops in code. Number of lines of code has been reduced. And, it doesn’t look like Java anymore :P</p>

<p>Sadly, this code doesn’t perform any better. And it is not very easy to understand this either. I like Lambdas. But they can easily become hard to understand.</p>
